# GA + DP to solve Travelling Salesman Problem 

Objective: 
Find the shortest path 

Requirements: 
1. Need to visit all the cities 
2. Need to return to the first point
3. Can not visit the same city twice

## Basic - Genetic Algorithm (GA) 

An optimization technique known as a genetic algorithm (GA) draws its inspiration from natural selection and evolution. 

### Step by step for GA

>1. Begin
 >> 2.    Initialization;
 >> 3.    Evaluation;
 >> 4.    Repeat 
 >> 5.    Selection;
 >> 6.    Crossover;
 >> 7.    Mutation;
 >> 8.    Evaluation;
 >> 9.    Until (Criteria Stopping);
>10.  End



## Modified  - GA + DP 
In the Dynamic Programming (DP) method, issues are divided into smaller subproblems, each of which is then solved in turn to produce a solution to the larger problem.

### Step by step for DP

>1. Begin
 >> 2.    Initialization;
 >> 3.    Evaluation;
 >> 4.    Repeat 
 >> 5.    Selection;
 >> 6.    Crossover;
 >> 7.    Mutation;
 >>>  8.   Apply DP approach
 >> 8.    Evaluation;
 >> 9.    Until (Criteria Stopping);
>10.  End
